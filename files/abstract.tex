New Horizons University is a modern university that is continually seeking to improve its processes, particularly with regard to student deliberation. In this thesis, we present an IT solution in the form of an application to help the university in this process.

Student deliberation is a complex process involving the analysis of several criteria, including academic performance. The proposed application takes this into account by tracking student data, such as course completions and transcripts. It also calculates percentages and generates a proposed transcript, as well as proposing a grade for each student.

The application will enable the jury to make a clear decision on the fate of students by providing relevant information and facilitating the deliberation process. It will also enable the university to gain time and efficiency in managing student data.

This work proposes a solution after a careful analysis of what exists, and how it is done elsewhere, to provide a relevant solution that adequately meets the university's needs.

We are proposing a solution that can be extended via a Rest API, which can easily communicate with other third-party services such as moodle and Google classroom, thus ensuring flexibility and independence.
